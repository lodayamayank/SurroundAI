						<h2>Basic AI Concepts</h2>
						
					</header>
					
                    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
					<p>First of all, machine learning is a core concept in artificial intelligence. All of us have to learn, and our human knowledge transfer is also carried out through such a method of learning. We learn the knowledge of our ancestors, and then create new knowledge by inference. We also hope that the machine has such ability: By learning the previous information, the machine is more like having intelligence and can react accordingly for new input in the future. This is called machine learning.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
                    <p>When we talk about artificial intelligence, we often hear concepts such as machine learning and deep learning. In fact, they are an inclusive relationship, and artificial intelligence includes machine learning and deep learning, and a specific form of learning in machine learning is called deep learning. It mainly based on algorithms of neural networks. At present, deep learning has made great progress in fields of image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, medical image analysis, and board game programs.</p>
					
                    <h2>Image Recognition</h2>	
                    <p>Image recognition is now widely used in our lives. For example, the identity of a person can be identified based on photos or when a personâ€™s face is captured with a camera. In many train stations in cities of China, you can swipe an ID card, the machine collects a face image of you with a camera, and then identify and verify your identity. Some building access control uses image recognition for identification, and you no longer need an access card or a key. Other applications include advanced human-computer interaction, video surveillance, automatic indexing of images, and video database, among others.</p>
                    <h2>Speech Recognition</h2>
                    <p>Speech recognition provides a faster and more convenient way for us to interact with computers. When we speak to the computer, it can know what we are talking about and interact with us. This method is completely different from what we used to type on the keyboard. This way of interacting with the computer can bring us many extended applications. Virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions.</p>
